This are the proyects that I most enjoyed doing during This school year (2024-2025)
I learned alot of functions when making these 2 projects. No copy pls original work.
These 2 are programs that do different functions, the #1 one is a plataform about an supermarker, in it you can create, remove and buy items. The #2 program is an inspiration of the popular game "monopoly" but with multiple diferences.
